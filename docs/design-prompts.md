# Design Prompts for Molly Parton

Prompts for AI-generated t-shirt and sweatshirt designs. The vibe: festival energy, psychedelic, Dolly-inspired, feral freedom.

## Prompt Tips for T-Shirt Designs

**Always include these for printable results:**
- "t-shirt design" or "screen print style"
- "white background" or "transparent background"
- "bold outlines" or "bold lines"
- "limited color palette" or "4 color screen print"
- "simple" "flat" "vector style"

**Avoid:**
- Too much fine detail (gets lost in printing)
- Gradients (hard to screen print, DTG handles them better)
- Realistic photography (doesn't print well, looks cheap)

## Print Considerations

| Print Method | Best For | Design Requirements |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **DTG (Direct to Garment)** | Full color, gradients, photos | Any design works, but keep it under 14" wide |
| **Screen Print** | Bold, limited colors, large orders | 1-6 colors max, no gradients, bold shapes |
| **Sublimation** | All-over prints, polyester only | Full color, edge-to-edge designs |

Printify mostly uses DTG, so you have flexibility. But "screen print style" designs often look better even when DTG printed.
